# Audit

<!-- GUIDANCE: Existing-project Phase 1 output. Instantiate in a dated folder —
     docs/audits/YYYY-MM-<slug>/audit.md, or a dated folder wherever the repo already keeps its
     plans — so the next audit doesn't overwrite this one and the two can be compared. Give every
     finding an ID, area.number (3.1, 3.2, …); the remediation plan cites findings by ID. Read the codebase before writing anything here. Every finding needs
     file-path evidence; a finding nobody can navigate to is an opinion. Label each finding with
     the same three levels the prompts use: *statically reviewed* (you read it), *executed* (you
     ran something and observed the result), or *fully validated* (you ran it and verified the
     outcome end to end). Anything short of executed is provisional. Where sources or code paths
     conflict, name the conflict and which one controls — don't merge silently. -->

Repo: **[REPO]** · Commit audited: `[HEAD SHA]` · Audited: [DATE] · Auditor: [WHO/WHAT]

Complete means: [COMPLETE_MEANS — restated from the project inputs]

<!-- GUIDANCE: Every gap below is a gap *against this*, not against perfection. -->

## Severity

<!-- GUIDANCE: Keep these definitions. The remediation plan uses the same ones; if it grades an
     item differently than this audit does, it says so and why, in the item. -->

- **Blocker:** cannot responsibly ship: data loss, a security hole, an authorization bypass, a
  broken core flow.
- **High:** will hurt users or the team soon: an unenforced guarantee, a silent failure path, a
  missing test on logic people depend on.
- **Medium:** real debt with a schedule.
- **Low:** polish.

## Baseline (run before reading for findings)

<!-- GUIDANCE: Install from a clean checkout and run every gate the repo claims to have, before
     anything else. Record the actual result, not the intended one. A baseline run is what
     exposes a gate that only passes with an undocumented flag, a test suite that silently
     skips, or a runtime mismatch between CI and production. Mark a gate *blocked (environment)*
     when it couldn't run here, and say what's missing. That's a finding in itself, not a pass. -->

| Gate | Command | Result | Notes (counts, skips, flags it needed, environment) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Install | `[INSTALL COMMAND]` | [PASS / FAIL / BLOCKED (ENVIRONMENT)] | [FILL IN] |
| Typecheck | `[COMMAND]` | [RESULT] | [FILL IN] |
| Lint | `[COMMAND]` | [RESULT] | [FILL IN] |
| Unit / integration tests | `[COMMAND]` | [RESULT] | [PASSED / FAILED / SKIPPED COUNTS] |
| E2E tests | `[COMMAND]` | [RESULT] | [FILL IN] |
| Build | `[COMMAND]` | [RESULT] | [FILL IN] |
| Dependency audit | `[COMMAND]` | [RESULT] | [COUNTS BY SEVERITY; WAIVED?] |
| Standards conformance | `[COMMAND]` | [RESULT] | [COUNTS BY STATUS; FAILING STANDARD IDS] |

Runtime: [VERSIONS — local, CI, and production, e.g. Node 22 / 20 / 24]

## Known issues going in

<!-- GUIDANCE: What users, testers, or the team already report: the bug tracker, playtest
     notes, support threads, a HARDENING or TODO file. These are often the highest-severity
     findings, and an audit that only reads code misses them. Link each one; say which audit
     section picks it up. -->

<!-- GUIDANCE: Each failing standard in the conformance scorecard is a finding in the area the
     scorecard prints beside it, and carries the standard's ID, so the next audit's scorecard
     lines up with this one. A standard the scorecard passes still leaves the area's
     judgment-based review to do. -->

<!-- GUIDANCE: Skipping an area requires a stated reason in its section. "No UI surface" is a
     reason; silence is not. Say what doesn't apply rather than inventing a finding for it: a
     static site with no backend has no server-side authz (§3), no database (§4), and nothing to
     answer "what failed for user X yesterday" (§9) beyond client error reporting; a library
     has no deploy (§7) or env module (§2). A missing typed env module is only a finding if the
     app reads environment variables. -->

## 1. Architecture & boundaries

<!-- GUIDANCE: Duplicate schemas, cross-layer imports, dead apps/packages, config drift, and the
     same value derived in more than one place (one of them will drift). -->

- **Current state:** [CURRENT STATE, WITH FILE PATHS]
- **Findings:**
  - **[ID — e.g. 1.1]** `[SEVERITY]` `[VERIFICATION LABEL]` [STANDARD ID, IF A STANDARD COVERS IT — e.g. `core.lf-line-endings` in §12] — [FINDING] (`path/to/evidence`)
- **Pattern that closes the gap:** [THE TARGET SHAPE, DESCRIBED CONCRETELY]

## 2. Type safety

<!-- GUIDANCE: Strictness at the strictest level the stack supports (TypeScript strict, or
     checkJs for a JS codebase, mypy/pyright strict, and so on), and whether it has regressed:
     a setting relaxed to unblock an emergency and never restored is a finding even when the
     code would now pass the strict setting. Any-leaks, unvalidated external data, a missing
     typed env module (only if the app reads env). -->

- **Current state:** [FILL IN]
- **Findings:** [FILL IN]
- **Pattern that closes the gap:** [FILL IN]

## 3. Auth & authorization

<!-- GUIDANCE: Server-side enforcement, session handling, tenancy on every multi-user table,
     privilege-escalation paths. This section and §8 justify the most audit time. -->

- **Current state:** [FILL IN]
- **Findings:** [FILL IN]
- **Pattern that closes the gap:** [FILL IN]

## 4. Data layer

<!-- GUIDANCE: Migration hygiene (does every migration have a revert, and has one been run?),
     N+1s, transactions around multi-step writes, identifier typing, blank-vs-zero handling,
     display precision vs stored precision. Client-persisted state counts too: localStorage,
     IndexedDB, saved files. Is it versioned, and is there a migration when its shape changes?
     A save format that silently drops fields on load is a data-loss finding. -->

- **Current state:** [FILL IN]
- **Findings:** [FILL IN]
- **Pattern that closes the gap:** [FILL IN]

## 5. Error handling

<!-- GUIDANCE: Swallowed exceptions, unhandled rejections, user-facing failure states,
     retry/timeout on external calls, and success reported for work that didn't happen (a job
     that logs "done" while the thing it feeds is empty; an import that reports success after
     a partial failure). -->

- **Current state:** [FILL IN]
- **Findings:** [FILL IN]
- **Pattern that closes the gap:** [FILL IN]

## 6. Testing

<!-- GUIDANCE: Unit coverage of core logic, edge cases, E2E of critical journeys. Then look for
     tests that can't fail, which count as findings, not coverage:
     - tests that assert nothing;
     - suites that never run in any gate (skipped by default, gated on fixtures CI doesn't
       have, an E2E suite with no recorded passing run);
     - coverage thresholds configured but not enforced in CI;
     - checks that report success after examining zero records;
     - test doubles (mock clients, in-memory DBs) that enforce none of the real backend's
       constraints. -->

- **Current state:** [FILL IN]
- **Findings:** [FILL IN]
- **Pattern that closes the gap:** [FILL IN]

## 7. CI/CD

<!-- GUIDANCE: Does CI run typecheck+lint+test+build, and is it a *required* check, so it blocks
     merge? Do scripts do what their names say (a `lint` script that only runs `tsc` means
     there's no linter)? Does CI run the same runtime version as production? Are there config
     keys that silently stopped working after a tool upgrade? Is the runtime pinned in one file
     that CI reads, and is that version still supported upstream (an end-of-life runtime in CI or
     production is a finding)? Also preview deploys, the
     rollback path, and whether the shipped artifact is ever checked, not just the config that
     produces it. Build settings that live only in a hosting dashboard (runtime version, build
     command, env var names) are a finding: nobody reviews or can restore them. The target
     shape is the release-runbook skeleton (docs/release-runbook.md). -->

- **Current state:** [FILL IN]
- **Findings:** [FILL IN]
- **Pattern that closes the gap:** [FILL IN]

## 8. Security

<!-- GUIDANCE: Secrets in code or git history, input sanitization, rate limiting on public
     endpoints, CORS/headers/CSP. A secret found in history is a blocker plus a rotation task, not
     just a deletion. Dependency audit: does one run in CI at all; does it block on
     high/critical (not `continue-on-error`, not runtime-only); does it also run on a schedule;
     are waivers reasoned, owned, and expiring, and is the register actually compared against the
     audit? The target shape is the dependency-policy skeleton (docs/dependency-policy.md). Also
     licensing: does the repo have a license, and do its dependencies' licenses permit the use?
     Client bundles: a secret behind a public prefix (VITE_, NEXT_PUBLIC_, EXPO_PUBLIC_, …), env
     reads the bundler doesn't inline, placeholder values, ${VAR} in eas.json (from a template
     checkout: npm run check:env -- --root <repo>). -->

- **Current state:** [FILL IN]
- **Findings:** [FILL IN]
- **Pattern that closes the gap:** [FILL IN]

## 9. Observability

<!-- GUIDANCE: Structured logging, error reporting, and the concrete test: can you answer "what
     failed for user X yesterday"? Is the reporter actually receiving events (a CSP or an ad
     blocker can silently drop them)? -->

- **Current state:** [FILL IN]
- **Findings:** [FILL IN]
- **Pattern that closes the gap:** [FILL IN]

## 10. Performance

<!-- GUIDANCE: Bundle size, obvious render/query hot spots. Measure (executed) or label it
     statically reviewed — never guess numbers. -->

- **Current state:** [FILL IN]
- **Findings:** [FILL IN]
- **Pattern that closes the gap:** [FILL IN]

## 11. Accessibility & UX completeness

<!-- GUIDANCE: Labels, focus, keyboard operability, contrast, and loading/empty/error states for
     every screen. An empty state that was never designed is a finding. -->

- **Current state:** [FILL IN]
- **Findings:** [FILL IN]
- **Pattern that closes the gap:** [FILL IN]

## 12. Docs, operability & stated-rule conformance

<!-- GUIDANCE: README accuracy, .env.example currency, ADRs for past decisions (backfill only the
     consequential ones), a deploy runbook. Then:
     - Stale committed artifacts: build logs, generated output, leftovers from a scaffolding tool
       or an AI studio that no longer describe the project.
     - Docs drift: routes, RPCs, or features the docs don't know about, and claims the code no
       longer backs.
     - Stated-rule conformance: for each rule in CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md/CONTRIBUTING (every write
       goes through an RPC, every migration has a revert, every change updates the docs), is it
       enforced, or only declared? A declared-but-unenforced rule is a finding.
     - User-facing claims nothing backs: numbers, comparisons, "secure", "compliant", "AI that
       understands", with no source, owner, or date (target shape: the claims register in
       docs/content-guide.md).
     - Agent instructions that contradict each other ("refactor first" vs "minimal diffs"),
       or that name paths, imports, or scripts that no longer exist, or carry characters a
       reviewer can't see (from a template checkout: npm run check:instructions -- --root <repo>).
     - Both a CLAUDE.md and an AGENTS.md, with no @AGENTS.md import in CLAUDE.md: Claude Code
       reads only CLAUDE.md, so the AGENTS.md rules never reach it. -->

- **Current state:** [FILL IN]
- **Findings:** [FILL IN]
- **Pattern that closes the gap:** [FILL IN]

## Conflicts

<!-- GUIDANCE: Where two sources of truth disagree (code vs. docs, schema vs. API, two configs) —
     name each conflict and which side controls. -->

- [CONFLICT] — controls: [WHICH, AND WHY]

## Refuted or corrected during verification

<!-- GUIDANCE: Before finalizing, re-verify every finding against the code, ideally in a separate,
     adversarial pass. Record here each finding that was dropped, and each whose evidence was
     corrected (a wrong line number, a narrower scope, a CVE that turned out not to be
     reachable). It stops the next audit re-deriving or re-litigating them. "None refuted" is a
     valid entry; an empty section is not. -->

- [FINDING ID] — [REFUTED / CORRECTED] — [WHAT THE VERIFICATION SHOWED]

## Coverage and limitations

<!-- GUIDANCE: What this pass did not do, so nobody reads it as a certified-complete audit: suites
     not run, tables not individually checked, areas covered only by static reading, anything
     assessed without running it. -->
