Run the existing-project audit-and-completion process, exactly as written in
`prompts/existing-project.md`. Read that file in full first — it is the authoritative
instruction set; this skill only wires it up. Then:

1. **Assemble the project inputs.** Parse whatever was given with the request, and map what you
   can onto the prompt's input fields (repo path/URL, current state, hosting, hard constraints,
   what "complete" means in user terms, known issues already reported, and repository
   visibility and GitHub plan). Visibility and plan never block: read them from the host, and
   assume private on GitHub Free for whatever can't be read, as the prompt's inputs say.
   `[COMPLETE_MEANS]`
   is the highest-leverage field — everything downstream is ordered against it — so if it's
   missing, ask for the missing fields in one question before starting.
2. **Honor the ground rules throughout:** the existing stack and conventions override this
   template and every reference; minimal diffs; flag refactors before making them; label
   every finding statically reviewed / executed / fully validated; never claim a test ran
   when it didn't.
3. **Execute the phases in order.** Phase 0 (reference verification) first — verify only
   the references relevant to this codebase's stack and list the skipped ones. Read the
   codebase before writing a word of the audit.
4. **Use the skeletons for the required artifacts.** They're in the skeletons directory:
   `<repo>/prompts/skeletons/` after `process:apply`, `<template>/templates/project/` in the template repo
   itself. The audit skeleton (baseline gate table, twelve areas, file-path evidence, severity,
   verification labels, refuted findings, coverage limits) and the remediation-plan skeleton
   (item fields, fixed ordering, small independently shippable milestones, or the single-PR
   form for a small project) are copied into a dated folder, `docs/audits/YYYY-MM-<slug>/`. Before reporting, run
   `LC_ALL=C grep -nE '[^]A-Za-z0-9_]\[[A-Z][^]]*\]([^([]|$)|^\[[A-Z][^]]*\]([^(:[]|$)|<!-- GUIDANCE'` on every artifact you produced; it must print
   nothing. From the template checkout, also run `node scripts/check-placeholders.mjs` on
   them; it catches a half-deleted guidance comment the grep can't see. Where the target lacks
   CLAUDE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, ADRs, or a typed env module, the remediation plan may draw on the other
   skeletons — as remediation items, not as wholesale replacements for what exists. Where it
   already has its own (or an AGENTS.md, Cursor rules, …), merge from the skeleton rather
   than adding a parallel file. Merged rules name this repo's real paths: rule 3's env module
   and rule 7's ADR folder and template point where this repo keeps them, and a rule whose file
   doesn't exist yet waits for the remediation item that adds it. For §12, run the template's
   `check:instructions` script from a template checkout
   (`node scripts/check-instructions.mjs --root <target>`) and record what it reports.
5. **Execute milestone 1** unless the constraints say plan-only. Within a milestone, don't
   stop for confirmation between agreed items; new issues discovered go into the plan
   explicitly rather than silently expanding scope.
6. **Log the run.** Add a row to `prompts/run-log.md` when the run starts, and fill in its
   outcome columns when it finishes, so an abandoned run still leaves a record. If the run
   exposed a gap in the prompt itself, note it in the same row. In the template repo, fix the
   prompt there. In a repo that got the prompts through `process:apply`, report the gap to the
   template instead and leave the delivered copy unedited: a re-apply only updates files you
   haven't edited (`prompts/README.md`, "Keeping the prompts current").
7. **Report** using the prompt's "Output of this prompt" contract.
